### About Layer5

[Layer5](https://layer5.io/) is an open source-first community of cloud-native engineers, they build products assisting fellow engineers and operators. They have been building the tools for cloud-native development and assisting us in knowing more about our infrastructure. The community has great aims and usefulness, which is built over the support of the community itself. They are bundling the variety of service-meshes with extensible support and helping your infrastructure get more powered with the existing resources.

### Starting as a contributor

Like many of you, I came to Layer5 to contribute and learn about the technology it uses. I might not need to tell you how awesome it is in terms of accommodating new members and making you feel at home. I received a warm welcome. You may try it yourself by [joining the community](https://layer5.io/community). I wanted to solidify my understanding of Docker, Kubernetes, and the various tech stacks used in their projects. I also wanted to learn more about service meshes. I'm grateful that working here allowed me to get to know each of them.

#### Zero knowledge of project and their core tech stack

A lot of us get uncomfortable seeing the large open-source codebase. I was no different. I had no knowledge of what a service mesh is and had zero understanding of their core language and the platforms they provide and work on. I only had React and Node with me. I took time, took a short break, learned about service meshes and more about Kubernetes. It's good to get familiar with the concepts you will work with. Otherwise, everything will go above your head, and you may not be able to persist a long-term run in the project development. As always, I got help from the existing members of Layer5, Lee Calcote, Utkarsh, and many others. They pointed me to some good resources and guided me in the right direction.

### My First PR

As I always suggest, I started with setting up the project as a user and developer. Meanwhile, I got issues with the installation scripts of Meshery. This way, I landed my [first PR](https://github.com/meshery/meshery/pull/3193) in Meshery, fixing the much required installation script, which further helped other users easily set up the project. One of the key points to consider as you are contributing or getting started with any project is noting down your problems, asking the community whether it is a valid problem or if it requires a fix. You can do it by creating [an issue](https://github.com/meshery/meshery/issues/3192). I continued slowly, very slowly, getting familiar with the tech-stack and community members. The community calendar is a must to subscribe to as it reminds you of development, newcomers, community, and other helpful meetings where you can query your problems and ask your doubts; don't be shy, they are only meant for you.

### Getting aback due to another internship, but still keeping smaller contributions

Meanwhile, I was actively looking for active internships for financial support. I had applied to mentorship programs in various organizations and was able to make some contributions in all those, or at least get on the calls to understand the project more. During that time, I got an LFX internship at [openEBS](https://openebs.io/), and I had to shift my focus from here. I was working on openEBS CLI that will be able to upgrade jiva volumes and its data plane. I had to learn a lot to make it successful and thus had the primary focus over there, but the Layer5 community was always in sync, and they always motivated to get some issues wrapped in Meshery. I had not made any major contributions, but I always tried to get something done on weekends when I got time out of my work.

### Learning things on go

We often feel under-confident about the tech stacks required in a new organization. My peers at Layer5 are a great example of overcoming the learning barrier and practicing learning as they go with the project. There are more technologies involved in a project than you can count. Staying back will never get you anywhere; take the problems as a challenge. Master the skill while making meaningful contributions along the way. You should be dynamic and always ready to learn while contributing to any project. The Layer5 community will significantly help you become accustomed to new things. Discuss, Prototype, Build, and Iterate is the principle we follow.

### Get Rewarded with Maintainership

Maintainership is always an accomplishment. It shows the trust of original authors in you. I have been mostly focused on the Meshery UI and MeshMap extensions. Thus I got the maintainership in these areas. Meshery is a broader area connecting a lot of service meshes and Kubernetes operations. Therefore, access to only certain domains comes up. Maintaining projects adds a whole new level of responsibility than just contributing. You are guarding the queen now. It's also more exciting at the same time. Did it take away my sleep?? Naah, just sometimes when I mess up with my own code integrating some new features or fixing some legacy code-base. Maintaining projects gives you authority, and the same is pushing you to learn more to talk about what you want to put forward. I remember times when I had to do research just to write a Github comment as an authority. I am lucky enough to get this experience from Meshery, where your words are heard.

### Technologies I work on daily

I mean, it's Layer5's Meshery. The development is dynamic, just like the RJSF schemas. I know I mentioned one already. Other than that, I primarily work on React, Next, Cytoscape.js, and Redux. There are 40-50 more dependencies in "package.json", I don't have to tell you more. Besides UI, I get indulged in Docker, Kubernetes, Github workflows, and recently in UI testing and integrations. The work is exciting. I am on my backlog's backlog. "Expect More from your Manager..."-the assignments...

### Fulltime Day 1: June 1

With the cheerful community support and part-time along the way, June 1 marks the Day 1 on my calendar. I have started full-time and already enjoying the work. The community, the people, and the project always hooked me up. I am mostly indulged in the development of Meshery and MeshMap, which are complementary to each other and great projects in the cloud native domain. It has operations, conformance, performance, designing, and visualizing, which supports all your infrastructure needs. The project is ripening with days, and the fruit is coming out to be sweet af. We are developing a project that is one of its kind and is a great help to the CNCF landscape. With Meshery, you are bound to "expect more from your infrastructure".

### We are hiring!

We are hiring cloud-native engineers possessing expertise in their fields. We are an open source-first community and believe in your work rather than a piece of paper, thus encourage you to indulge in the community and try out your hands on the projects. The community is always there to assist you in need.
