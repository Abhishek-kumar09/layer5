### About Layer5

[Layer5](https://layer5.io/) is an open source-first community of cloud-native engineers, they build products assisting fellow engineers and operators. They have been building the tools for cloud-native development and assisting us in knowing more about our infrastructure. The community has great aims and usefulness, which is built over the support of the community itself. They are bundling the variety of service-meshes with extensible support and helping your infrastructure get more powered with the existing resources.

### Starting as a contributor

Like many of you, I had come to Layer5 to contribute and learn about the technology it uses. I might not need to tell how awesome it is in terms of accomodating new members and making you feel home, you may try yourself by [joining the community](https://layer5.io/community). I was welcomed with utter love as a lot of us are welcomed. I was interested in learning the tech stacks, service meshes, and wanted to solidify my understanding in Docker and Kubernetes, and have been thankful enough to get to know each of them while working.

#### Zero knowledge of project and their core tech stack

A lot of us get uncomfortable seeing the large open-source codebase, I was no different. I had no knowledge of what a service-mesh is, having zero understanding of their core language and platforms they provide and work on. I had only React and Node with me. I took time, took a short break, learnt about service-meshes, and more about kubernetes. It's good to get familiarity with the concepts you are going to work on otherwise everything will go above your head and you may not be able to persist a long term run in the project-development. As always, I got the help from the existing members of Layer5, Lee calcote, Utkarsh, and many others. They pointed me to good resources and directions in the project I knew nothing about.

### My First PR

As I always suggest, I started with setting up the project as a user and developer, meanwhile I got issues in installation scripts of meshery and this way I got my [first PR](https://github.com/meshery/meshery/pull/3193) landed in Meshery fixing much required installation script, that had further helped other users easily setup their project. One of the key point while you are contributing or getting started with any project is noting down your problems, asking the community whether it is a valid problem you are facing or it requires a fix, you can do it by creating [an issue](https://github.com/meshery/meshery/issues/3192). I continued slowly, very slowly, getting familiarity with tech-stack and community members. The community calendar is a must subscribe to as it reminds of development, newcomers, community and other such helpful meetings where you can query your problems and ask your doubts; don't be shy, they are only meant for you.

### Getting aback due to another internship, but still keeping smaller contributions

Meanwhile, I was actively looking for active internships for the financial support, I had applied to mentorship programs in various organisations and was able to manage putting some contributions in all those, or atleast getting on call to understand about the project more. During the time, I got an LFX intership at [openEBS](https://openebs.io/), and I had to shift my focus there, I was working on openebs CLI that will able to upgrade jiva volumes and its data plane. I had to learn a lot to make it successful and thus had the primary focus over there, but the Layer5 community was always in sync and they always motivated to get some issues wrapped in Meshery. I had not done any major contributions, but I always tried to do something done on weekends when I get time out of my work. 

### Learning things on go

We often feel under-confident about the tech-stacks required in a new organisation. My peers at Layer5 are great example of overcoming the learning barrier and practicing learning as they go with the project. There are more number of technologies involved in a project than you count, staying back will never get you anywhere; take the problems as a challenege to master the skill while doing meaningful contributions along the way. You should be dynamic and always ready to learn while contributing to any project, the Layer5 community will be a great help to you in getting you accustomed to new things. Discuss, Prototype, Build, Iterate is the principle we follow.

### Fulltime Day1: June 1

With the cheerful community support, and part-time along the way, June 1 marks the day 1 in my calendar. I have started the full-time and already enjoying the work. The community, the people and the project always hooked me up. I am mostly indulged in development of Meshery and MeshMap which are compliment to each other and is a great project in the cloud-native domain. It has got operations, conformance, performance, designing, and visualising, which supports your all needs of your infrastructure. The project is rippening with days and the fruit is coming out to be sweet af. We are developing the project that is one of its kind and is a great help to CNCF landscape. With Meshery, you are bound to "expect more from your infrastructure".

### We are hiring!

We are hiring cloud-native engineers possessing expertise in their fields. We are open-first community and believes in the work over peice of paper, thus encourage you to indulge in the community and try out your hands on the projects. The overwhelming community is always there to assist you in need.
